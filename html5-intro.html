    <h2>What is HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML5 is the newest version of HTML. The term refers to two things. One is the updated HTML language itself,
        which has new elements and attributes. The second is the larger set of technologies that work with this new
        version of HTML — like a new video format — and enable you to build more complex and powerful websites and apps.
    </p>
    <h2>What's new in HTML5</h2>
    <h3>Intro of audio and video:</h3>
    <p>Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their
        website.</p>
    <h4>Example for audio tag</h4>

    <audio src="assets/media/goat.mp3" type="audio/mp3" controls></audio>
    <!-- For embedding two or more audio type  -->
    <!-- <audio controls autoplay>
        <source src="/html5/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
        <source src="/html5/audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio> -->

    <h3>Source code example for video tag</h3>
    <video src="assets/media/video.mp4" width="200" controls></video>
    <p>NB. We have to keep in mind tha both the audio and video tag isn't working simultanously in the same page</p>

    <h3> Scalable Vector Graphics:</h3>
    <p>This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites.
        It
        can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS.</p>
    <h4>Example drawing circle</h4>
    <svg height="200">
        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" fill="red">
    </svg>
    <h4>Example drawing rectangle</h4>
    <svg width="400" height="150">
        <rect width="400" height="150" fill="green">
    </svg>
    <h4>Example Star</h4>
    <svg width="300" height="200">
        <polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198"
            style="fill:lime;stroke:purple;stroke-width:5;fill-rule:evenodd;" />
    </svg><br>

    <h3>Header and Footer:</h3>
    <p>With these new tags, there is no longer a need to identify the two elements with a
        div tag. Footer is placed at the end of the web page while Header is placed at the start of the web page. By
        using
        header and footer HTML5 elements, the browser will know what to load first and what to load later. </p>

    <h3>Figure and Figcaption: </h3>
    <p>HTML5 allows to use a 'figure' element to mark up a photo in a document, and a 'figcaption' element to define
        a
        caption for the photo. The 'figcaption' tag defines a caption for a 'figure' element. This tag provides a
        container for content that is equivalent to a figure. It can be used to group a caption with one or more
        images,
        a block of code, or other content.</p>

    <h4>Example</h4>
    <figure>
        <img src="gadget.jpg" alt="my dream gadgets" width="400">
        <figcaption>Dream gadgets</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Nav tag:</h3>
    <p>The
    <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links. It is used for the part of an internet site that links to
        different
        pages at the website. The hyperlinks can be organized through a number of approaches. Common examples of
        the nav
        elements are menus, tables, contents, and indexes. This element makes it much easier to create a
        navigation
        menu, creates a neat horizontal menu of text links, and helps screen reading software to correctly
        identify
        primary navigation areas in the document.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <h1> HTML Nav tag</h1>
        <nav>
            <a href="/html/">HTML</a>
            <a href="/css/">CSS</a>
            <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a>
            <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
        </nav>
        <h3>Progress tag:</h3>
        <p>The progress tag is used to check the progress of a task during the execution. Progress tag can be used with
            the conjunction of JavaScript.</p>
        <h4>The progress element</h4>

        <label for="file">Downloading progress:</label>
        <progress id="file" value="32" max="100"> 32% </progress>

        <h3>Placeholder Attribute:</h3>
        <p>The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of an input field/text
            area. The short hint is displayed in the field before the user enters a value.</p>

        <h3></h3> Email attribute:</h3>
        <p>When the input type in the form set as email, then the browser gets the instruction from the code to write a
            valid format email. The input email id is automatically validated to check the format of the email id is
            correct or not.</p>
        <h3>Storage:</h3>
        <p>In the case of HTML, we can use the browser as the temporary storage whereas, in the case of HTML5,
            application cache, web SQL database, and web storage is used.</p>

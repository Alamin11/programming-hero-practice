    <h2>What is HTML5</h2>
    <p>HTML5 is the newest version of HTML. The term refers to two things. One is the updated HTML language itself,
        which has new elements and attributes. The second is the larger set of technologies that work with this new
        version of HTML — like a new video format — and enable you to build more complex and powerful websites and apps.
    </p>
    <h2>What's new in HTML5</h2>
    <h3>Intro of audio and video:</h3>
    <p>Audio and Video tags are the two major addition to HTML5. It allows developers to embed a video or audio on their
        website.</p>
    <h4>Source code Example for audio tag</h4>

    <!-- <audio src="goat.mp3" controls type="audio/mp3"> -->
    <!-- For embedding two or more audio type  -->
    <!-- <audio controls autoplay>
        <source src="/html5/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
        <source src="/html5/audio.wav" type="audio/wav" />
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
    </audio> -->

    <h3>Source code example for video tag</h3>
    <video src="video.mp4" width="300" controls></video>
    <p>NB. We have to keep in mind tha both the audio and video tag isn't working simultanously in the same page</p>

    <h3> Scalable Vector Graphics:</h3>
    <p>This is a new addition to the revised version which has hugely impacted the use of Adobe Flash in websites. It
        can be used to draw graphics with various shapes and colors via scripting usually JS.</p>
